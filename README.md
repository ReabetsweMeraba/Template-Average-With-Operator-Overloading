# Template Average with Operator Overloading

This C++ project demonstrates the use of:
- **Function templates** to calculate averages of primitive types.
- A custom `computations` class with overloaded `+` and `/` operators to compute averages of user-defined objects.
- **Friend function** for custom stream output using `<<`.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Template-based `average()` function works with both built-in types and user-defined class objects.
- Overloaded `+` and `/` operators to simulate custom arithmetic between `computations` objects.
- Basic object-oriented programming practice.
